# Moneyball - Oakland A's
## Background
In the early 2000s, the Oakland A's developed a strategy to redefine what makes a player valuable. 
They figured out what player characteristics translated to wins and realized that they exploit this and pay less
for players that other teams didn't value as much.

## Goal
Using the data extracted Sean Lahman's sqlite database, I want to understand how efficient teams have been historically at spending money
and getting wins in return and illustrate the impact that the Moneyball strategy had on the Oakland A's.
